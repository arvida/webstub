# Example webstub app 

It queries the [Open Beer Database API](http://openbeerdatabase.com/documentation/beers-get) for beers. See `find_beer_test.go` for more the stubbing example.

## Usage

```shell
$ go run find_beer.go Ambergeddon
Found 1 beers
---
Ambergeddon, 6.8%
With a fury of hop flavor and a hint of malt backbone, this west coast amber is part ale, part sensory eruption, and all American.
